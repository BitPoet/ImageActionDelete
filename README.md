# ImageActionDelete
ProcessWire module that adds a delete icon to grid view of FieldtypeImage

## What it does

In grid view for an image field, there's already a button to crop the image
when you hover over it with the mouse. This module adds a delete button
next to it. A click calls the same code as a delete click in list view does.
